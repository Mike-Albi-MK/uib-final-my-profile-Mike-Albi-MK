            <p>new best friend!</p>
            <p>My name is Mike Albrecht.</p>
            <p>I'm a web developer, art designer and writer in Berlin.</p>

            <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>

            <img class="img1" src="./images/marzahn.jpg" alt="view of marzahn springbrunnen">
            <h4>My Location</h4>
            <p>Gazing at the 'Fernsehturm', window shopping at the Kudamm or immersing yourself in the true meaning of the word 'Kiez'. Yes, I live in Berlin and love it. It's truly a city where you can feel and meet various cultures and personalities once you step outside. I know it all, I haven't seen everything. And you can learn more about Berlin on this <a href="https://www.visitberlin.de/de" target="_blank">site</a>.
            </p>

            <h4>My Profession</h4>
            <p>Staring at the desktop, moving pixels until dawn. Who cares about regular working hours? Nah, it is not always that way. But web development keeps you on your toes. There is a new riddle to be cracked for every customized solution. And you definitely want to be someone who likes to feel the heartbeat of the ever-evolving 'flux'.
            </p>

            <img class="img3" src="./images/guitaramp.jpg" alt="">
            <h4>My Passion</h4>
            <p>How do I detach myself from work? How do I maintain my relationship with the real world? I literally strike a chord on my guitar. It can be challenging and comforting at the same time. I still want to learn to become an uber-shredder but it is also rewarding to just play around with simple chords and melodies.

                <h3>SKILLS</h3>


            <img class="img4" src="./images/webstuff.jpg" alt="picture of a spider web">
            <h4>Web Development</h4>
            <p>This is the right place to tell you something about web stuff. Coding with structure, making things interactive and responsive. Everything for the best and most entertaining user experience. So please, stay tuned. There is more to come.
            </p>


            <img class="img5" src="./images/art4.jpg" alt="painting of colors clashing">
            <h4>Art Design</h4>
            <p>There is world outside. A place that is not particularly defined by margin and padding or screen sizes. Well, not all the time. I'm speaking of art and communication design. This is where it all can come down to creating the right catch phrase or translating the most abstract thoughts into our reality.
            </p>

            <h4>Writing</h4>
            <p>My ever haunting nemesis. The blank sheet of paper. Look how it is grinning at me. I'm not afraid to take on the challenge. Articles, business reports, campaign guides, short stories and even some screenplay projects â€“ I've written it all and I'm not gonna give up. </p>
